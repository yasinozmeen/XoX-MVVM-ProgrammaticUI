# XoX-MVVM-ProgrammaticUI

The aim in this application was to understand the MVVM architecture and establish an online structure. Additionally, during the construction of this application, I learned the completion handler and protocol delegate structure.

### The packages I used in the application.
1. Firebase Auth
2. Firebase Firestore
3. SnapKit
